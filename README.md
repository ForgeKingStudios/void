## About

VOID is a fantasy computer that you can use to make, play and share tiny retro-looking games and programs. It comes
with a default, fully customizable, DOS-like operating system installed, called DiskOS.

DiskOS provides an environment with basic command line programs and visual game editors.

The created games and programs are saved as disk files that can be easily shared to friends or anyone else.

### Available on

[![Itch.io](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/Itch.io/red?label=%20)](https://ramilego4game.itch.io/liko12)

## Documentation

The documentation is scattered and available over multiple places:

- In the [cheatsheets](https://liko-12.github.io/#/Documentation/Cheatsheets/) (best resource I believe).
- [VOID GitHub Webpage](https://liko-12.github.io/) (sufferes from changing navigation bar issues).
- [Another GitHub Webpage](https://liko-12.github.io/WIP/) (an attempt to get better documentation).
- Via a Discord bot on [VOID's Discord](https://discord.gg/adjqkd639F)
- In a JSON format on the [API-Documentation Repository](https://github.com/LIKO-12/API-Documentation) (used by the Discord bot).

The demos and games included could be used as a last resort before reading the source-code.

## Source-code Overview

VOID was made using the awesome [LÃ–VE Framework](https://love2d.org) and written purely in Lua.

Lua is a simple scripting language that used to be very good back in the days, and it could still serve as a good start for beginners with some care to overcome the obstacles of moving into other well known languages like JavaScript. (Although Python is a better choice for learning programming)

There are lots of ninja crimes in the codebase, where I sacrificed code readability to feel satisfied in doing something so hacky and Lua specific. Very sorry for that ðŸ˜¬

As the project has grew over the years, it has been split into multiple repositories under the [VOID Organization](https://github.com/LIKO-12)

## Project Status

The project is unfortunately no longer developed nor maintained.

## Thanks to the LÃ–VE Community
